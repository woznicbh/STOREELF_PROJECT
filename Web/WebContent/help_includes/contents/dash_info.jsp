            <h6>A new "Stores Metrics" screen has been added - and the link will be visible in the "Dashboard" menu of STOREELF. This dashboard will have the three sections- "Inventory Snapshot", "Fulfillment Performance" and "eFC Redundancy Statistics".

Inventory snapshot in this page displays all the available inventory at the Store and not just what has been identified for Ship From Store fulfillment

Under each of these sections, the same columns will be present as in the main Quick Metrics screen. An expandable list of "Stores" will be shown under each of the section - the expansion will be in the following hierarchy.
<ol>
<li>All Stores</li>
<li>Regions</li>
<li>States</li>
<li>Individual Stores</li>
</ul>
