              to nodes with summarization of stores to an all store
              level. This report will also show a summary by order age
              of the orders that were resourced with information split
              on resourced from nodes and resourced to nodes.

            </h6>

              will start showing cancels from RDCs and Stores listed in
              the data tab. A summary sheet for this report needs to be
              created. There will be two summaries - one reports the
              number of resourced orders by the number of cancelled
              orders and the number of units cancelled by each node. The
              second summary shows as list of resourcing nodes with the
              number of orders split by order created date.
