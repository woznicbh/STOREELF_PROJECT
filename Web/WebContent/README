STOREELF EXPANSION TUTORIAL

Below are the simple steps required to expand LobHub’s existing architecture.
1)	Creating a new Section

			•	Example: “report.jsp” copy the content from the ‘example_includes/example.jsp’
	o	Creating Sidebar
			You will need to also create a sidebar jsp file in that directory with the name of your component followed by ‘_sidebar.jsp ’ in all lowercase alphanumeric characters, DO NOT USE CAMELCASE
			•	Example: “report_sidebar.jsp” copy the content from the ‘example_includes/example_sidebar.jsp’ and adjust to include your logic
